Welcome to the Simon Says Game! This game is a fun and challenging way to test your memory and attention. The goal is to remember and repeat an increasingly long sequence of tile flashes. Let's see how far you can go!

How to Play
Start the Game:

Click any key on your keyboard to start the game.
Level 1:

After pressing any key, one of the four tiles will flash.
Click on the tile that flashed to complete Level 1 and proceed to Level 2.
Level 2 and Beyond:

In each new level, an additional tile will flash in sequence.
You must remember the sequence of all previously flashed tiles along with the new tile flash.
Click on the tiles in the exact order they flashed.
Incorrect Click:

If you click the wrong tile at any point, the game will end, and your score (the number of levels you successfully completed) will be displayed.
Rules
Pay close attention to the sequence of tile flashes.
Click the tiles in the exact order they flashed to proceed to the next level.
Each level adds one more tile to the sequence.
The game gets progressively harder as the sequence gets longer.
Scoring
Your score is the number of levels you successfully complete.
Try to beat your previous high score each time you play!
Tips
Focus and memorize the sequence carefully.
Use mnemonics or patterns to help remember longer sequences.
Stay calm and don't rush your clicks.
